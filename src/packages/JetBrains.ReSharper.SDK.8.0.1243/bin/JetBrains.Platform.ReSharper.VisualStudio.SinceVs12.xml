            <summary>
            Here we got the new “Embedded Peek Text View” inserted as an island inside a big text view, which we also would like to treat as a text control, and it actually does not have a VS Window Frame on its own (only document/toolwindow frames seem to have one).
            We still need a valid VS window frame to operate the control correctly — at least for detecting its visible state (to suppress some operations when not) and for forcing it into view when needed.
            We would create a window frame object for this control (not bound to VS entity), then find its parent text view sitting in a real document frame and create a window frame for it, then link the former as a child of the latter.
